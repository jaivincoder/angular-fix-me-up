// TODO: 5. Fixing one thing may break other things, but sometimes it has to be done

// Jaivin comment
//Here, nothing seems to be wrong; everything was used to reserve the space for the header, main, and  footer. Considering the same design is required, nothing should be changed.
//As the main content should have some space on both sides, which is getting handled by the paddings, I have changed it to shorthand.
// It depends on the design as well. Assuming the design should not be changed, otherwise changes could have been made as per requirements.
//Now the header and footer are as per the requirements. Considering not changing the rest of the design,  do not need the first two properties which were mentioned before.

main {
  // try to keep these
  min-height: 100vh;
  // don't  really care about the below
  padding: 0px 20px;
}
